# Storage in south eastern Australian catchments

This repository contains some scripts that download data and
peform analysis to estimate storage in some catchments across
south eastern Australia. The accompanying paper for this 
analysis has been submitted for review.

The scripts are gererally laid out in sequential order, but first
the Australian Water Availability Project and Hydrologic Reference
Station data needs to be downloaded using the scripts in the R
directory. The characteristics have been extracted and are included
in the repo.
